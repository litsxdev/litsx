# @litsx/typescript-plugin

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 4a81cd6: Add `static ... = ...` as the primary static hoist syntax across LitSX authoring, formatting, tooling, and scaffolding.

  Legacy `^...` hoists still work in this release, but they now emit deprecation warnings so projects can migrate before removal.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 791414f: Added support for renderer helpers imported across files, package specifiers, and project aliases such as `@/...`, so imported renderers can participate correctly in native lowering and static elements analysis.

  Improved compiler performance for repeated project builds by caching imported renderer module analysis per compilation session, which significantly reduces warm compile times for multi-file and alias-heavy projects.

  Improved `@litsx/typescript-plugin` project typecheck performance by caching stable diagnostics across repeated runs when project files have not changed, reducing repeated `litsx-tsc` costs while preserving invalidation when source versions move.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cef2428: Publish the scoped runtime as `@litsx/litsx` and realign the public package surface on `0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5321478: Publish the initial public npm release as version 0.1.0 through the automated Changesets pipeline.
