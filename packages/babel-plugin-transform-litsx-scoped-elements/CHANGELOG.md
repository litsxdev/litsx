## 0.4.8

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1dfa4f1]
  - @litsx/babel-plugin-shared-hooks@0.7.0

## 0.4.7

### Patch Changes

- 8b39fd6: Fix native ref forwarding so authored `ref` props are not overwritten by the host fallback when a component explicitly forwards the ref to a native element or child component. Named local callback refs on native elements are now lowered through the DOM ref lifecycle path, enabling composed local/public refs.

  Align intrinsic label/output typing and diagnostics so LitSX-authored native elements can use the DOM-aligned `for` attribute while `htmlFor` remains compatibility syntax.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1e586fa]
  - @litsx/babel-plugin-shared-hooks@0.6.0

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- 1c9b206: Recognize `useId` imported from `@litsx/core` and `useContext` imported from `@litsx/core/context` as LitSX runtime hooks during shared custom-hook analysis so custom hooks that call them are compiled with the active host instead of being treated as unresolved imported hooks. The preset now classifies LitSX runtime hooks by known runtime import source plus the public `useX` naming convention instead of maintaining a duplicated hook allowlist.

  Rename compiler-facing structural runtime helpers from `useStructuralEntry(...)` and `useStructuralStaticEntry(...)` to `resolveStructuralEntry(...)` and `resolveStructuralStaticEntry(...)`. These helpers are emitted by the compiler/runtime bridge and are no longer named like authored user-space hooks.

  - @litsx/babel-plugin-shared-hooks@0.5.0

## 0.4.4

### Patch Changes

- 69264c9: Add host middleware runtime plumbing and structural hook compiler wiring. `defineHook({ static, setup, middlewares, use })` is the public mixed structural-hook authoring API and returns a callable hook value enriched with compiler/runtime metadata. The compiler now separates class/type structural work from instance work: static-only hooks lower to `useStructuralStaticEntry(...)` and generated `structuralStaticEntries` without `HostMiddlewareMixin(...)`, while mixed/instance hooks lower to `useStructuralEntry(...)`, generated hosts are wrapped with `HostMiddlewareMixin(...)`, and direct structural hook callsites emit static `structuralEntries` so lifecycle middleware exists before first render. Local and imported custom hooks can carry compiled structural metadata, structural hook readers can expand nested structural usage, and structural hooks that call other structural hooks from `use(...)` now expose metadata for imported consumers. The preset can discover named or namespace structural hook imports from authored modules using relative, path-alias, or TypeScript module resolution, including imported static-only hooks. Structural entries remain one-to-one with authored callsites; resource dedupe belongs in hook-specific runtimes. Unsupported dynamic structural-hook patterns such as aliases, object/array containers, runtime selection, and computed namespace access now fail during transform with actionable code-frame diagnostics.

  The native preset also now creates an early static IR for inferred properties, authored `static properties`, element candidates, imported element candidates, and light-DOM intent so future static-hoist migrations can consume compiler metadata before late class-member emission. Element candidate analysis, scoped-elements, React lazy, and static-hoist processing now use that IR instead of parallel private annotations.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 05bb013: Resolve scoped element candidates declared as top-level aliases of namespace imports.
- Updated dependencies [73790b9]
- Updated dependencies [d7cb8a1]
  - @litsx/typescript-session@0.2.3
  - @litsx/babel-plugin-shared-hooks@0.3.1

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- c432761: Declare direct runtime dependencies explicitly so strict package managers such as Yarn Plug'n'Play can resolve the published LitSX toolchain without undeclared dependency errors.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 0394450: Unify package build configuration on the shared Rollup helper and improve LitSX editor diagnostics for destructured component props without explicit metadata.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 677553b: Normalize DOM runtime mixins around root mode: `ShadowDomMixin` and `LightDomMixin` are now the canonical mixins, and `LightDomMixin` also handles scoped light-DOM elements when `static elements` is present.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 191fc0d: Introduce canonical package names for the LitSX runtime, TypeScript integration, and authored JSX tooling.

  `@litsx/core`, `@litsx/typescript`, and `@litsx/authoring` are now the recommended packages. The previous `@litsx/litsx`, `@litsx/typescript-plugin`, and `@litsx/jsx-authoring` packages remain available as compatibility wrappers.

  Generated scaffolds, compiler output, presets, and tooling defaults now target the canonical package names while preserving compatibility with projects that still use the previous names. The canonical element/scoped-registry helpers now live at `@litsx/core/elements`; `@litsx/litsx/runtime-infrastructure` remains available as the legacy compatibility subpath. Rendering helpers now live at `@litsx/core/rendering`, and TypeScript source virtualization helpers now live at `@litsx/typescript/virtualization`.
